This file descripes my experience with the assignment.

What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any?
  Might be funny, I first forgot to check whether the 3 parameters can form a triangle or not,
  I kept trying to check the cassifyTriangle funtion and everytime I got the wrong answer.
  Finally, I got it working by checking the 3 parameters first.

What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
  I think the requirments are incomplete, and here's why:
    - The requirements specification does not specify which programming language to use.
    - The requirements specification does not specify the type of the parameters, are they integers? floats?

What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
  None.

Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
  I wrote test for both right and wrong values, for example, I tested whether a triangle with 5,6,7 as parameters, as you
  can see, 5,6,7 should be a scalene, and the tests confirms this, see below:
  self.assertNotEqual(classifyTriangle(5,6,7),'Isosceles','5,6,7 is not isosceles')
  self.assertEqual(classifyTriangle(5,6,7),'Scalene','5,6,7 is a scalene')
